Objective:
    The goal is to score higher than the computer over a set number of rounds

How to play:
    At the start of your turn, type 'R' to roll your 3 dice

    The scores will be determined by adding the dice values.

    During the players turn, they are allowed to re-roll any dice that are not "fixed" until they decide to stop

    If 2 dice have the same value, they are "fixed" and cannot be re-rolled

    Also if all 3 dice have the same value, you "Tuple Out" and score 0 points for the round
